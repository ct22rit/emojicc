# Emoji-Based Covert Channel

## Description
This project implements a novel system for covert communication using emojis. It encodes text messages into emojis, adds noise for obfuscation, and uses Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating contextually relevant texts that embed the encoded messages.

## Installation
- Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.
- Set up an environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your OpenAI API key.

## Usage
### Encoding Text
- **Usage**:
  ```python
  python3 sender.py

### Decoding Text
- **Usage**:
  ```python
  python3 receiver.py
